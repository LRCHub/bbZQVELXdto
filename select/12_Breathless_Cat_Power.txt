It's up in the morning
And on the downs
Little white clouds
Like gamboling lambs
And I am breathless over you
And the red-breasted robin
Beats his wings
His throat it trembles
When he sings
For he is helpless before you
The happy hooded bluebells bow
And bend their heads all a-down
Heavied by the early morning dew
At the whispering stream
At the bubbling brook
The fishes leap up to take a look
For they are breathless over you
Still your hands
And still your heart
For still your face
Comes shining through
And all
The morning glows anew
Still your mind
Still your soul
For still
The fare of love is true
And I am breathless without you
The wind circles among the trees
And it bangs about the new-made leaves
For it is breathless without you
The fox chases the rabbit round
The rabbit hides beneath the ground
For he is defenseless without you
The sky of daytime dies away
And all the earthly things
They stop to play
For we are all breathless without you
I listen to my juddering bones
The blood in my veins
And the wind in my lungs
And I am breathless without you
Still your hands
And still your heart
For still your face
Comes shining through
And all
The morning glows anew
Still your soul
Still your mind
Still, the fire of love is true
And I am breathless without you

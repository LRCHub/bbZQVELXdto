My eager eyes came stumbling down
Over this pristine view
My second-rate poetry
Just is not enough to describe you

I'm scrambling 'round the floor
Looking for some fresh metaphor
All the words to describe this just do not exist
I feel better than ever before

I'm breathless and speechless
But still, there is so much to say
In words with one syllable

I love you
